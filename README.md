# README for Keyselector Module

## Overview
The `keyselector` module is a Verilog design for generating a clock signal based on musical keys. It determines the key pressed and computes a corresponding frequency, which is then used to produce a clock signal of appropriate timing. This module can be used in applications that require specific musical note-based clock signals or timing references.

## Features
- Supports 12 input signals (A through L) representing musical keys.
- Computes the frequency for each key using a frequency formula based on the musical key number.
- Generates a clock signal that toggles at the computed frequency.
- Includes a `testclock` task to calculate the time period based on the input key.

## Ports
- **Inputs:**
  - `A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L`: Binary inputs representing musical keys.
- **Outputs:**
  - `key`: Integer output representing the current key number.
  - `clock`: Clock output toggling at the frequency corresponding to the input key.

## Internal Components
- **Variables:**
  - `timerr`: A real number representing the period of the clock in nanoseconds.
  - `enable`: A register used to enable or disable the clock generation.

## Functionality
### Key Selection
- The module monitors the input signals (A to L) to detect which key is pressed.
- If any input is active, the `enable` signal is set to 1.
- The corresponding key number is assigned based on the input that is active.
- The `testclock` task calculates the frequency for the selected key, and the period is stored in `timerr`.

### Clock Generation
- When the `enable` signal is high, a clock signal is generated by toggling at the calculated period (`timerr`).
- The clock toggles until all inputs are deactivated.

## Task: `testclock`
- **Inputs:**
  - `key` (integer): The key number corresponding to a musical note.
- **Outputs:**
  - `timerr` (real): The calculated period for the clock in nanoseconds.
- **Description:**
  - The task computes the frequency using the formula `freq = 440 * (1.059463094^(key-49))`.
  - The task then calculates the time period `timer = 1/freq` and converts it to nanoseconds.

## Usage Notes
- Ensure that only one input (A to L) is active at a time to avoid unexpected behavior.
- The module assumes standard musical key frequency mapping based on a reference of 440 Hz for key 49 (A4).
- The clock output is set to zero when no input keys are active.

## Example of Key Mapping
- `A` corresponds to key 40.
- `B` corresponds to key 41.
- `C` corresponds to key 42.
- ...
- `L` corresponds to key 50.

## Limitations
- The code currently lacks extensive comments and readability improvements.
- Potential improvements include adding more robust input validation and error handling.

## Future Enhancements
- Improve readability and add descriptive comments.
- Implement additional features to handle simultaneous key presses or chord generation.
- Allow dynamic scaling of the clock frequency based on user-defined parameters.
